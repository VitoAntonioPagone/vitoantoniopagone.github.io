  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I’m <strong>Vito</strong>, from <strong>Ostuni</strong>, a small white town in southern Italy.  
    I’ve always been that person who can’t stop asking how things work — too curious for my own good, maybe.  
    Technology, programming, algorithms, math, physics, football… anything that challenges me instantly grabs my attention.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love solving problems — not just to make things work, but to make them <em>beautifully logical</em>.  
    Whether it’s building data pipelines, training machine learning models, or simply figuring out how to automate something dull,  
    I’m happiest when I’m learning, creating, and exploring new ideas.
  </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>

 <div class="job">
  <h3>Data Scientist – UBS</h3>
  <p><em>Mar 2024 – Present | Zürich, Switzerland</em></p>
  <p>
    I work in the <strong>AI & Data Science team</strong> within <strong>Global Wealth Management</strong> in Zurich.  
    Our small but mighty subgroup, <strong>Trading Analytics</strong>, collaborates closely with the <strong>Execution Hub</strong> —  
    the place where client orders meet the market. My focus is on <strong>post-trade analytics</strong>, using 
    <strong>machine learning</strong> to tackle real problems that make trading smarter and faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    My daily toolkit revolves around <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Airflow</strong>. I build and maintain data pipelines that keep 
    our analytics flowing — Airflow is a brilliant ally for transforming internal data efficiently and transparently.  
    I’m also part of the <strong>AI Journal Club</strong>, where we regularly discuss new research papers and explore 
    how fresh ideas can shape our work.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Lately, I’ve been automating <strong>report generation for best execution</strong>, so our insights are always 
    clear, consistent, and just a click away.
  </p>

<div class="job">
  <h3>Machine Learning Intern – IBM Research</h3>
  <p><em>Nov 2023 – Jan 2024 | Zürich, Switzerland</em></p>
  <p>
    Although a short experience, it was an incredibly inspiring one.  
    I worked on the idea that if <strong>machine learning models</strong> are trained to predict physical phenomena from simulation data,  
    they should also be given some <strong>prior knowledge of the underlying physics</strong>.  
  </p>
  <p>
    At IBM, I explored how <strong>atmospheric and climate equations</strong> could be embedded directly into the loss function of a forecasting network  
    to guide convergence — especially during the early training epochs.  
    It was fascinating to see how blending data and physics can produce more stable and interpretable results.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond the technical side, I got to experience the <strong>IBM Research culture</strong> —  
    collaborating with brilliant people from around the world.  
    I left genuinely grateful for the opportunity and the mindset it gave me.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="job">
  <h3>Machine Learning Researcher & Python Developer – ETH Zurich</h3>
  <p><em>Feb 2023 – Jan 2024 | Zürich, Switzerland</em></p>
  <p>
    My time at <strong>ETH Zurich</strong> brought together teaching, coding, and research in a way that shaped how I think about science and communication.  
    As a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> for the MSc course <em>Introduction to Scientific Computing</em> taught by <strong>Prof. Roman Vetter</strong>,  
    I created <strong>interactive Jupyter notebooks</strong> to help students visualize algorithms and truly understand how they work —  
    making complex numerical methods more tangible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later, as a <strong>Machine Learning Researcher</strong>, I continued my <strong>Master’s thesis</strong> work,  
    developing <strong>Graph Physics-Informed Neural Networks (GPINNs)</strong> to improve field reconstruction accuracy in fluid dynamics.  
    This phase focused on preparing the research for publication — an effort I pursued under the guidance of <strong>Dr. Bogdan Danciu</strong>.  
    It was a deeply rewarding experience that combined curiosity, persistence, and the excitement of turning theory into something real.
  </p>

<div class="job">
  <h3>Intern – MAN Energy Solutions</h3>
  <p><em>Sept 2022 – Mar 2023 | Zürich, Switzerland</em></p>
  <p>
    This internship marked my first real step into the world of applied <strong>fluid dynamics</strong> and <strong>computational physics</strong>.  
    I worked on a <strong>simulation framework</strong> to reproduce the <strong>supersonic two-phase flow of CO₂</strong> through converging–diverging nozzles —  
    a fascinating problem that taught me how physics and code can complement each other beautifully.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was also my first time working in a <strong>company environment</strong>, and it helped me grow both technically and personally.  
    I became much more confident with <strong>Linux systems</strong> and <strong>scientific programming</strong>,  
    gaining hands-on experience in writing, testing, and running simulations at scale.
