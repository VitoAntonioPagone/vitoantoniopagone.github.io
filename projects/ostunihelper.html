    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  OstuniHelper was born in the summer of 2024 from an idea by my brother <strong>Samuele</strong> and me.  
  We wanted to build a single, welcoming entry point for tourists and residents in Ostuni — a place where anyone can easily find everything they might need during their stay: restaurants, tours, events, weather updates, and more.  
  We started with a simple online prototype, but soon decided to develop it <strong>entirely from scratch</strong>.  
  Today, the project has grown into a mature, full-stack platform powered by <strong>OstuniAI</strong>, our multilingual assistant that provides real-time, personalized suggestions and insights.  
  The platform continues to evolve and improve, always staying true to its goal — making Ostuni even more accessible, connected, and enjoyable for everyone.  
  For those curious about the technical side, explore the <strong>Architecture section</strong> below.

  If you’ve reached this part — get ready for some friendly nerdiness!  
  Under the hood, <strong>OstuniHelper</strong> is a modern full-stack platform built with love and precision.  
  The frontend runs on clean <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, styled using a compiled version of <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> for performance and consistency.  
  On the interactive side, <strong>JavaScript</strong> powers the chat interface, category navigation, and translation logic, ensuring that every click and conversation feels smooth and natural.  
  <br><br>
  Behind the scenes, everything is handled by a <strong>Flask</strong> backend running on an <strong>Ubuntu VPS</strong>.  
  Requests are managed through <strong>Gunicorn</strong> and served securely via <strong>Nginx</strong>, making the system fast, reliable, and scalable.  
  All the activities, services, and experiences you see inside OstuniHelper (and <strong>OstuniAI</strong>) are stored in a <strong>MySQL database</strong>.  
  Each category — whether it’s restaurants, tours, or events — has its own dedicated API endpoint that fetches structured data directly from the database.  
  <br><br>
  Media files such as images are hosted in an <strong>AWS S3 container</strong>, ensuring quick global access to all visuals.  
  On top of this, <strong>OstuniAI</strong> ties everything together: it allows users to explore the same content conversationally.  
  Thanks to a <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> system, the AI can intelligently extract and present data, almost as if it were clicking the same buttons you see in the interface — only faster and smarter.  
  <br><br>
  Finally, we introduced <strong>PromOstuni</strong>, the city’s promotion hub where local offers and events are shared directly through the platform.  
  Visitors can even subscribe to a newsletter and stay up-to-date with what’s happening around town.  
  <br><br>
  Altogether, it’s a growing ecosystem — part technology, part passion project — designed to make Ostuni more connected, welcoming, and future-ready.
