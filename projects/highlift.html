    <h1>Numerical Investigation of Momentum Injection Based High-Lift Wing</h1>
    <p><em>Semester Project – ETH Zürich, Institute of Fluid Dynamics</em></p>
  </header>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project was developed during my Master’s studies in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> at <strong>ETH Zürich</strong>,
      under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Dr. Patrick Jenny</strong>. It focuses on one of the most challenging and fascinating
      areas of aerodynamics — <strong>active control of flow separation</strong> to increase lift efficiency on aircraft wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study investigates the concept of <strong>momentum injection</strong> through a slat located on the suction side of a wing.
      By injecting a small amount of high-energy air into the boundary layer, the method aims to delay or even prevent
      flow separation, enhancing aerodynamic performance during takeoff and landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work combines mathematical modeling, numerical methods, and turbulence analysis to understand how 
      <strong>active flow control</strong> could lead to more efficient, sustainable aircraft designs.

    <h2>Technical Highlights</h2>
    <p>
      The numerical solver developed for this project is based on the <strong>Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)</strong> equations,
      reduced to a parabolic boundary-layer form. Using a <strong>k–ω turbulence model</strong> and finite-difference discretization,
      the solver can simulate complex flow behaviors over both uniform and non-uniform meshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model was validated against experimental data from literature, achieving excellent agreement in predicting
      turbulent boundary layers and trailing-edge separation. The results confirm the solver’s ability to capture
      boundary-layer dynamics with high numerical accuracy and computational efficiency.
